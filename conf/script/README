INTRODUCTION
============

These example script files enable a chromecastmanager server to play / queue media files
when linked to from ifttt.

The IFTTT query must be in the format:

{
  "textfile": "preset one on hall speaker"
}


PROXY AND PROTECTION
====================

It is recommended that the messages are passed to the chromecastmanager via a proxy
e.g. nginx - Ideally, the proxy should only accept requests from specific addresses
and also reject messages that are not correctly formatted, for example, the nginx 
server could be configured to accept https queries to /apikey-a9ae21-1029afd-1029458/play, 
and only forward these to the chromecastmanager /play script.

The json script will launch the pre-processor 'play.pl' which parses the "textfile"
parameter to identify the speaker and the media to be played.


MEDIA PLAYLISTS
===============

This media can come from one of three sources:

 * /etc/conf/playlist/presetN.db
 * /etc/conf/playlist/channelN.db
 * http://mediaserver/media/search.pl?q=xyz

The files in the playlist folder must be in the format:

 http://url/,Description of source

Note that the separator comma can be replaced by any character < 32 which is not \n, \r or \t.
The first character on the line that meets these criteria is used as the separator.

These files can contain a sequence of media files if necessary.
Or just one media stream url - e.g. from an ezstream shoutcast server.
Or a search list of internet radio station streams

The mediaserver search files must be in the same format.

Note also that lines starting with # are ignored, as is the ,Description if not present
This means that an m3u file is accepable as a playlist source.


MEDIA SERVER SCRIPTS
====================

Some example scripts which can automatically build a 'database' of files can be found
in the mediaserver folder.  This comes in two parts - the first being a script which
can build the data base files (recommended to be run as a cron job) and the second being
a cgi script to perform the search and return a list of media to be played.

These files should be placed on the media server. The search.pl and corresponding media 
files should also be served via http from the media server.
